<div class="mediaCentercontent" style="display: none;">
<p>The Government of India has granted general permission to NRI / PIO / OCI to buy property in India and they do not
have to pay any taxes even while acquiring the property in India. However, taxes have to be paid if they are selling
this property. Rental income earned is taxable in India, and they will have to obtain a PAN and file a return of the
income if they have rented this property. On sale of the property, the profit on sale shall be subject to capital gains.
If they have held the property for less than or equal to 3 years after taking actual possession then the gains would be
short term capital gains, which are to be included in their total income and will be taxed in the normal bracket.
However, if the property has been held for more than 3 years, then the resulting gain would be labelled as long term
capital gains subject to 20% tax and some additional levy (cess)</p>

<span class="small" data-event-category="section" data-event-action="click" data-event-name="FAQs"><strong class="black">07</strong>How does the Double Taxation Avoidance Agreement (DTAA) work in the context of tax on income and Capital Gains tax paid in India by NRI?</span>
<div class="mediaCentercontent" style="display: none;">
<p>DTAA is Double Taxation Avoidance Agreement. India has signed this treaty with many countries like USA, UK,
Canada, UAE etc. In layman terms, what it means is that you will not be taxed twice on the same income. Income
from India is also treated as an Income in your Home Country. Assuming, you sold a property in India. It will be taxed
in India and also in your home country. DTAA allow capital gains to be taxed in India against the sale of property in
India. NRI/PIO/OCI can avail tax credit in their home country against taxes paid in India.</p>

<li>
<span class="small" data-event-category="section" data-event-action="click" data-event-name="FAQs"><strong class="black">05</strong>Does Capital Gains Tax (CGT) apply to NRI / PIO / OCI? How is it calculated?</span>
<div class="mediaCentercontent" style="display: none;">
<p>Yes. Long-term and short-term capital gains are taxable in the hands of non-residents.</p>
<p>
CGT is calculated by ascertaining the type of asset like house property, land and building, jewellery, development
rights, etc. and the rate of tax deduction at source (TDS), which is:-  <br/>
<strong>Long term</strong> 20.6% <br/>
<strong>Short term</strong> 30.9%  <br/>
</p>
<p>
<strong>Exemption available (only for long term capital gains)</strong> <br/>
The long term capital gains arising on sale of a residential house can be invested in buying/constructing another
residential house, within the prescribed time. The exemption is restricted to the amount of capital gains or the
amount invested in new residential house, whichever is lower. If the amount of capital gains is invested in bonds of
National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) or Rural Electrification Corporation, then the entire capital gains is
exempted, or the proportionate gain is exempted. As per the financial budget 2007-08, a cap of INR. 50 lakhs has
been imposed on investment that can be made in capital tax saving bonds.</p>

<span class="small" data-event-category="section" data-event-action="click" data-event-name="FAQs"><strong class="black">05</strong>How does Double Taxation Avoidance Agreement work in the context of CGT paid in India on the foreign tax
treatment?</span>
<div class="mediaCentercontent" style="display: none;">
<p>In case the non-resident pays any tax on capital gains arising in India, he would normally be able to obtain a tax
credit with respect to the taxes paid in India/ home country, because the income in India would also be included in
the country of tax residence. The amount of tax credit is also on the basis of computing the tax credit that can be
claimed as specified in the respective country’s DTAA and is also dependent on the laws of the home country where
the taxpayer is a tax resident.</p>

<span class="small" data-event-category="section" data-event-action="click" data-event-name="FAQs"><strong class="black">05</strong>What should I know about filing tax returns?</span>
<div class="mediaCentercontent" style="display: none;">
<p>
If you are an NRI / OCI / PIO, you would have to file your income tax returns if you fulfil either of these conditions:
&bull; Your taxable income in India during the year was above the basic exemption limit of INR.1.6 lakh OR
&bull; You have earned short-term or long-term capital gains from sale of any investments or assets, even if the gains are
less than the basic exemption limit.
</p>

<p>
There are two exceptions:
&bull; If your taxable income consisted only of investment income (interest) and/or capital gains income and if tax has been
deducted at source from such income, you do not have to file your tax return.
&bull; If you earned long term capital gains from the sale of equity shares or equity mutual funds, you do not have to pay
any tax and therefore you do not have to include that in your tax return.
You could file your tax return either by giving a power of attorney to someone in India or by sending your form and
documents to a tax expert in India who would then file the return on your behalf.
But nowadays, the easiest option for NRIs to file their Indian tax returns is by using the online platform. There are
several options to file online.
</p>
<p>
Note: The enhanced exemption limit for senior citizens and women is applicable only to Residents and not to Non-
Residents.

Every bank and housing finance company follows the RBI guidelines to define an NRI - "An Indian citizen who holds a valid document like an Indian passport and who stays abroad for employment or for carrying on business or vocation outside India or stays abroad under circumstances indicating an intention for an uncertain duration of stay abroad is an NRI."
Broadly categorized, Non-Resident Indians qualifying for NRI housing loans are:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Indian citizens who stay abroad for employment or for carrying on business or vocation outside India or for any other purpose in circumstances indicating an indefinite period of stay abroad</li>
<li>Government servants who are posted abroad on duty with the Indian missions and similar other agencies set up abroad by the Government of India, where the officials draw their salaries out of Government resources</li>
<li>Government servants deputed abroad on assignments with foreign Governments or regional/ international agencies like the World Bank, International Monetary Fund (IMF), World Health Organization (WHO), Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (ESCAP)</li>
<li>Officials of the State Government and Public Sector undertakings deputed abroad on temporary assignments or posted to their branches or offices abroad</li>
<li>Documents required for Resident Indians and NRIs for getting home loans are different in some respects. Home loans for NRIs are available for construction of new houses/ flats, purchase of old house/ flat addition/ alteration to an existing house and repairs/ renovation etc. NRIs can avail of loans by mortgaging an existing residential property. However, for availing home loans, NRIs have to fulfil certain conditions, according to the provisions of the Income Tax Act. They should have stayed in India for a period of 182 days or more within an assessment year or they should have stayed in India for at least a total of one year or more.</li>
<li>The FDI policy that permits FDI up to 100% from a foreign/ NRI investor under the automatic route has boosted NRI confidence. Banks have attractive NRI housing schemes to accommodate the housing needs of NRIs. From the stables of HFCs, NRI housing finance plans with suitable repayment options are available.</li>
<li>Last but not the least, NRIs should take due care while selecting their home loan provider companies or HFCs. Considering the geographical distances involved, it is significant that loan seekers associate with a proactive and responsive HFC.</li>

<div class="mediaCentercontent" style="display: none;">
<p>
The eligibility criteria for NRIs differ from Resident Indians based on a few parameters. The parameters include:
</p>
<table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="10" border="1">
	<tr>
		<th>Age</th>
		<th>Qualification</th>
		<th>Income</th>
		<th>Payment options</th>
		<th>Number of dependants</th>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>The loan applicant has to be 21 years of age.</td>
		<td>The NRI loan seeker has to be a graduate.</td>
		<td>The loan applicant has to have a minimum monthly income of $ 2,000 (although, this criterion may differ across HFCs). The eligibility is also determined by the stability and continuity of employment or business.</td>
		<td>The NRI also has to route his EMI (Equated Monthly Instalment) cheques through his NRE/ NRO account. He cannot make payments from another source such as, his savings account in India.</td>
		<td>The eligibility of the applicant is also determined by the number of dependents, assets and liabilities.</td>
	</tr>
</table>
<p>
	Home loans for an NRI applicant ranges from a minimum of INR. 5 lakhs to a maximum of INR. 1 crore, based on the repayment capacity and the cost of the property, which although is variable by the priorities of the home loan provider. An applicant will be eligible for a maximum of 85% of the cost of the property or the cost of construction as applicable and 75% of the cost of land in case of purchase of land, based on the repayment capacity of the borrower.
</p>
<p>
	However, the eligibility can be enhanced by applying for home loans with a co-applicant who has a separate source of income. Also, the rate of interest for home loans to NRIs is higher than those offered to Resident Indians. The difference is somewhere between 0.25%-0.50%. Some HFCs also have an internally earmarked 'negative criterion' for NRI home loans. As such, the NRIs who hail from locations that are marked as being 'negative' in the books of HFCs, find it difficult to get a home loan.

<div class="mediaCentercontent" style="display: none;">
<p>
The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has clarified that Non-Resident Indians (NRIs) and Persons of Indian Origin (PIO), purchasing immovable property in India must pay for the acquisition by funds received in India through normal banking channels by way of inward remittance from outside the country.
</p>
<p>
	The NRIs and Resident Indians can also acquire immovable property in India other than agricultural property, plantation or a farmhouse. It has issued certain directives for sanctioning home loans to Non-Resident Indians.
</p>
<p>
	However, the eligibility can be enhanced by applying for home loans with a co-applicant who has a separate source of income. Also, the rate of interest for home loans to NRIs is higher than those offered to Resident Indians. The difference is somewhere between 0.25%-0.50%. Some HFCs also have an internally earmarked 'negative criterion' for NRI home loans. As such, the NRIs who hail from locations that are marked as being 'negative' in the books of HFCs, find it difficult to get a home loan.
</p>
<p>
	<strong>The guidelines provided are:</strong>
</p>
<ul>
<li>The home loan amount should not exceed 85% of the cost of the dwelling unit, As the remaining 15% needs to be provided by one's own contribution towards the cost of unit financed</li>
<li>The cost of dwelling unit which is by own contribution financed less the loan amount, can be met from direct remittances from abroad through normal banking channels, the Non-Resident (External) [NR(E)] Account and/ or Non-Resident (Ordinary) [NR (O)] account in India</li>
<li>However, repayment of the loan, comprising of the principal and interest including all the charges are to be remitted to the HFC from abroad through normal banking channels, the Non-Resident (External) [NR(E)] Account and /or Non-Resident (Ordinary) [NR (O)] account in India</li>
</ul>
<p>
	The repayment option for NRIs is that they can pay through the funds held in any non-resident account maintained in accordance with the provisions of the Foreign Exchange Management Act, 1999, and the regulations made by the RBI from time to time.

<div class="mediaCentercontent" style="display: none;">
<p>
Apart from the documents mentioned below, a vital document required while processing any NRI home loan is the ‘Power of Attorney’ (POA). Since the borrower is not based in India, the POA is important because HFCs would need a 'representative' 'in lieu of' the NRI to deal with if necessary. Although not obligatory, the POA is usually drawn on the NRI's parents/ wife/ children.
</p>
<p>The documents needed for obtaining NRI home loans are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Passport and Visa</li>
<li>A copy of the appointment letter and contract from the company employing the applicant</li>
<li>The labour card/ identity card (translated in English and countersigned by the consulate) if the person is employed in the Middle East Salary certificate (in English) specifying name, date of joining, designation and salary details</li>

	Home Loans for first time buyers
</p>
<p>Some popular home loan products include Floating and Fixed home loan interest rates. As the name suggests, Floating rates fluctuate in accordance with base rates or the BPLR (whatever the case maybe). As far as fixed home loan interest rate products go, you can avail of two types - fixed for the entire tenure or fixed for a certain period of time. But if the interest rate is fixed for the entire tenure of the loan, then the EMI of your housing loan will be fixed for the entire tenure of the loan. But in case the interest rate is fixed only for a specific tenure say 5 years, the bank can change its interest rate every 5 years.</p>

	<span class="small" data-event-category="section" data-event-action="click" data-event-name="FAQs"><strong class="black"></strong>Home Loan Application Process:</span>
	<div class="mediaCentercontent" style="display: none;">
		<p>
			From applying for a home loan to getting it approved, involves various stages:  <br>
			<strong>Step 1: Filling the application form</strong><br>
			Filling up the application form is the first step. The type of the application form may differ from bank to bank, but nearly 80 percent of the information they need is similar. Most of this is basically your personal and professional information, details of your financial assets and liabilities and the details of the property (if finalized) including the estimated cost and the means of financing the same.
		</p>
		<p><strong>Documents to submit:</strong></p>

		<p>
			While submitting the application form, every bank asks for several documents. Most banks these days offer doorstep service, however, some banks still insist on a personal visit to their office at least once.
		</p>
		<p>
			<strong>1. Proof of income:</strong><br>
			This needs to be backed up by copies of last three years' Income Tax returns (along with copies of Computation of Income/Annual accounts, if any), Form 16/Form 16A, last three months' salary slips, copies of the last six months' statements of all your active bank accounts in which your salary/business income details are reflected, etc. Other documents that you need to provide with your application form include age proof, address proof and identification proof. You may also be asked to provide your employment details.
		</p>
		<p>
			<strong>2. Age proof:</strong><br>
			Copy of your Driver’s license/Passport/Ration card/PAN card/Election Commission's card/etc.
		</p>
		<p>
			<strong>3. Address proof: </strong><br>
			Similar documents need to be provided to prove that you are actually staying at your current address.
		</p>
		<p>
			<strong>4. Identification proof:</strong><br>
			Same as above, but with photograph. Sometimes, the same document if it contains a photograph, the current residential address and the age can be used.
		</p>
		<p>
			<strong>5. Your employment details:</strong><br>
			If your company is not well-known, then a short summary about the nature of the company, its business lines, its main customers, its competitors, number of offices, number of employees, turnover, profit, etc may be needed. Usually, the company profile that is available on the standard website of the company is sufficient.
		</p>
		<p>
			<strong>6. Financial check: </strong><br>
			All the income-related documents you submit serve a specific purpose. The lending institution uses them to study your financial status.
		</p>
		<p>
			<strong>The bank statements you submit are scrutinized for:  </strong><br><br>
		</p>
		<p>
			<strong>1. Level of activity</strong><br>
			In the case of self-employed individuals, this gives a very good clue about the extent of business activities.
		</p>
		<p>
			<strong>2. Average bank balance</strong><br>
			A cursory glance at the average bank balances maintained in a savings bank account speaks volumes about the spending/saving habits of any individual.
		</p>
		<p>
			<strong>3. Cheque returns</strong><br>
			A small charge debited by your bank in the statement indicates that a cheque issued by you was returned by your bank. Many such cheque returns can have a negative impact on your loan sanction.
		</p>
		<p>
			<strong>4. Cheque bounces</strong><br>
			If cheques deposited by you are returned by the issuer's bank, they will be visible in your bank statement and again, banks have specific norms as to how many such returns are acceptable in a period of one year.
		</p>
		<p>
			<strong>5. Regular periodic payments</strong>
			The existence of periodic payments to other finance companies/banks etc. indicate an existing liability and you will need to provide full details to the lender.
		</p>
		<p>
			<strong>6. Your investments also come under the scanner.</strong>
			This helps the bank to estimate your ability to pay the down payment as well as your savings habit.
		</p>
		<p>Along with the application form and the credit documents, banks ask for a processing fee. This fee varies from bank to bank, but is usually around 0.25% to 0.50% of the total loan amount </p>

		<p><strong>Step 2: Personal discussion</strong><br>
		After you've formally and successfully completed the application process, all you have to do is wait till the home finance institution evaluates your papers.<br>
		The wait normally lasts only a day or two or sometimes even less. However, some banks insist on meeting you after receiving the application form, and before the loan sanction. This is to gather more details about you that may not be mentioned in the application form and to reassure them of your repayment capacity. Again, this stage is insisted upon only in very few cases these days.</p>

		<p><strong>Step 3: Bank's Field Investigation</strong><br>
		The bank checks all your information including your existing residential address, your place of employment, employer credentials (if you are employed in a small organization), residence and work telephone numbers. Representatives are sent to your workplace or residence to verify the details.<br>
		Even the references you have provided in the application form are verified. While this may seem invasive, banks are forced to undertake validation in the absence of any credit bureau. Once your credentials are validated, it helps establish trust between you and the bank.
		</p>

		<p><strong>Step 4: Credit appraisal by the bank and loan sanction</strong><br>
		If the bank is not convinced about your credentials, your application may get rejected. If it is satisfied, your loan is sanctioned.<br>
		The bank or the home financier establishes your repayment capacity based on your income, age, qualifications, experience, employer, nature of business (if self-employed), etc., and based on these, works out your maximum loan eligibility, and the final loan amount is communicated to you. The bank then issues a sanction letter. This letter may either be an unconditional letter, or may have certain terms and conditions mentioned, which you have to fulfill before the loan disbursement.
		</p>
		<p><strong>Step 5: Offer letter</strong><br>
		Once the loan is sanctioned, the bank sends you an offer letter mentioning the following details:<br>
			<ul>
				<li>Loan amount</li>
				<li>Rate of Interest</li>
				<li>Whether fixed or variable rate of interest linked to a reference rate</li>
				<li>Tenure of the loan</li>
				<li>Mode of repayment  </li>
				<li>If the loan is under some special scheme, then the details of the scheme</li>
				<li>General terms and conditions of the loan</li>
				<li>Special conditions, if any</li>
			</ul>
		</p>
		<p><strong>Step 6: Submission of legal documents & legal check</strong><br>
		Every bank conducts a legal check on your documents to validate their authenticity. Even the draft sale documents that you will be entering into with your seller will be scrutinized. The documents are sent to a lawyer on their panel (either in-house or outsourced) for a thorough scrutiny. The lawyer's report either gives a go-ahead if documents are clear, or it may ask for a further set of documents. In the latter case, you are expected to hand over the additional documents to the bank for a clear title.<br>
		So, if a bank decides to disburse your housing loan, you can safely assume that your property documents are clear and the transaction is safe. Sometimes the bank may ask you to pay for the legal verification. However, most banks cover the costs in the upfront (processing) fee that you pay. Property documentation in India is non-standard and, in certain cases, non-transparent. Hence, it helps to buy property from a reputed developer since they know the process inside out, and keep all the documents ready. Due to the heavy transfer charges on sale of property and/or very heavy stamp duties, some people conduct sale of property by showing "lower consideration" than agreed for, with the balance being paid either on an amenities agreement or in cash. Also the concept of sale by executing "irrevocable power of attorney" has gained ground especially in the National Capital Region. All this could restrict the choice of your lenders and may therefore increase the cost of the loan, which you might want to keep in mind while finalizing such properties.</p><br><br>

		<p><strong>1. Technical / Valuation check - Making Double Sure: </strong><br>
		Banks are extremely careful about the property they plan to finance. They send an expert to visit the premises you intend to purchase. This expert could either be a bank employee or s/he could belong to a firm of architects or civil engineers.</p>
		<p><strong>Site visit: </strong><br>
		The site visits to your property are conducted to verify the following:</p>
		<p><strong>In case of under construction property:</strong><br>
			<ul>
				<li>Stage of construction is the same as that mentioned in the payment notice given to you by the builder.</li>
				<li>Quality of construction.</li>
				<li>Satisfactory progress of work.</li>
				<li>Layout of flats and area of the property is within permissions granted by the governing authority.</li>
				<li>The builder has the requisite certificates to start construction at the site. Valuation of the property in relation to other deals in the surrounding areas.  </li>
			</ul>
		</p>
		<p><strong>Site visit: </strong><br>
		The site visits to your property are conducted to verify the following:<br><br>
		<strong>In case of under construction property is ready/resale construction :</strong><br>
			<ul>
			<li>External / internal maintenance of the property.</li>
			<li>The age of the building.</li>
			<li>Will the building last the loan tenure- This has a direct bearing on your loan eligibility, since the loan tenure will be restricted to the maximum age of the property as decided by the bank's engineer and this will impact your loan eligibility.</li>
			<li>Quality of construction.</li>
			<li>1Surrounding area (development). </li>
			<li>1Whether the builder has received the requisite certificates for handing over possession of the flat. </li>
			<li>1There is no existing lien or mortgage on the property.</li>
			<li>1Valuation of the property in relation to other deals in the surrounding areas.</li>
			<li>1These inspections are carried out to protect consumer interests in terms of construction quality, adherence to local laws, approved building plans, etc. A technical inspection also lets the bank understand the progress of construction so as to release the staggered disbursements.</li>
			</ul>
		</p>
		<p><strong>Step 7: Technical / Valuation check</strong><br>
		Since the risk associated with the diversion of funds is higher than if the loan was used for genuine purposes, banks carry out an independent valuation to find out whether the transaction is in line with the existing market price of the area.<br>
		Valuation has become a key parameter in determining the loan amount that can be sanctioned by the bank. The valuation process is quite subjective and depends on the quality and ability of the person sent by the bank for valuation.</p>

		<p><strong>Step 8: Valuation</strong><br>
		The valuation issue rarely arises when a property is purchased through a reputed builder directly or if the property is pre-approved. In both the cases, the banks would have already completed the valuation and therefore, you can safely assume that there is no difference between the documented cost of the property and the bank's valuation amount.</p>

		<p><strong>Step 9: Registration of property documents</strong><br>
		After the legal and technical / valuation check, the draft documents as cleared by the lawyer need to be finalized and signed and the stamping and registration of the documents need to be done. Also, if any NOCs are pending, these need to be obtained in the format approved by the bank's lawyer.</p>

		<p><strong>Step 10: Signing of agreements and submitting post-dated cheques</strong><br>
		All borrowers need to sign the home loan agreement. You also need to submit post-dated cheques for the first 36 months (if that is the agreed mode of repayment). The original property documents have to be handed over to the bank at this stage. Some banks also create a document recording the handing over of the property documents to them as security for the due repayment of the home loan.</p>
		<p><strong>Step 11: Disbursement</strong><br>
		After the bank has ensured that the property is legally and technically clear, all the original documents pertaining to transfer of ownership of property in your favour have been submitted and all the necessary loan agreements have been executed, it is time for disbursement. Before this, you need to submit documents to prove that you have paid your personal contribution towards the property, since banks normally finance only up to 85-90 percent of the total cost of the house. In case you are expecting money from other sources to fund your own contribution, you need to provide sufficient evidence for the same. It is only after submitting this proof that the bank will release part-disbursement of the loan.<br>
		The cheque will be in the name of the reseller (for resale flats), builder, society or the development authority. It is only in exceptional circumstances, that is, if you provide documents to support that you have made an excess payment from your own account that the cheque will be handed over to you directly by the bank.</p>

<h3>REAL ESTATE (REGULATIONS AND DEVELOPMENT) ACT, 2016</h3>

<li>
<span class="small" data-event-category="section" data-event-action="click" data-event-name="FAQs"><strong class="black">05</strong>What is RERA?</span>
<div class="mediaCentercontent" style="display: none;">
<p>The Real Estate (Regulation and Development) Act, 2016 paves way for empowering all stakeholders engaged in the
business and consumption of Real Estate, be it consumers, Real Estate Developers, and Real Estate agents amongst
others. All commercial and residential real estate including plots, apartments, shops, offices and other such
properties are covered under the Act. While consumer interest seems to have been finally addressed by the adoption of the Act, it can’t be ignored that the Government has codified best practices for the first time in this sector and these will go a long way in defining growth from here on.</p>
<p>A few of the overarching themes in the Act are as follows –</p>
<ul>
<li>1. Regulatory oversight on real estate developers and real estate agents</li>
<li>2. Purchaser’s rights and duties</li>
<li>3. Real estate developers’ function, duties and obligations</li>
<li>4. Real estate agent’s duties and functions</li>
<li>5. Dispute resolution</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
The Real Estate (Regulation and Development) Act, 2016(“the Act”) is an umbrella legislation designed to provide a
framework for both Central and State Government. The Act is a Government of India initiative to bring about the
much needed transparency and order in real estate related transactions by creating a systematic and a uniform
regulatory environment, thereby protecting consumer interest and making real estate developers accountable for
timely completion of projects. The Act paves the way for setting up of Real Estate Regulatory
Authority(“Authority”) at every State for regulation and promotion of real estate sector while promoting
transparency and equity in real estate transactions.</p>

<li>
<span class="small" data-event-category="section" data-event-action="click" data-event-name="FAQs"><strong class="black">05</strong>What was the need for setting up Authority?</span>
<div class="mediaCentercontent" style="display: none;">
<p>a. The real estate sector has grown in the recent years but has largely been unregulated from the perspective of
consumer protection. Though, consumer protection laws are available, the recourse available therein is only
curative, but not preventive. This has affected the overall potential growth of the sector due to the absence of
professionalism and standardization.</p>

<p>b. The functions of the Authority includes promotion of real estate sector, advocacy by creating awareness, imparting
training about laws relating to the real estate sector and policies, regulating and registering real estate developers
and agents, maintaining website, ensuring compliance of obligations cast upon real estate developers and other such
functions provided under the Act and State Rules.</p>

<p>c. The Act brings stakeholders like consumers, real estate developers and the real estate agents- under the purview of
the Authority in order to ensure compliance of the Act by the stakeholders. The Act empowers the States to
introduce its own rules to accommodate the need of its own unique geographies without diluting the provisions of
the Act. The Act also provides for appropriate Government of two or more States or Union Territories (UTs) to
establish single Authority.</p>
