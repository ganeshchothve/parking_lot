Design a parking lot
 which can hold n cars of different color and different registration numbers.
 
Every car has been issued a ticket for a spot and the spot has been assigned based on the nearest to the entry point.

The system should also return some queries such as:
 * Registration numbers of all cars of a particular Color. 
 * Ticket number in which a car with a given registration number is placed. 
 * Ticket numbers of all tickets where a car of a particular color is placed. 
 
 # This should be a simple command line utility with minimum these capabilities. They can develop a simple UI instead of CLI based. - create a parking lot - park cars in it - run the above specified queries 


Scenarios.

  let parking_site : Abhyuday, total_spots : 8, spot_statuses : available

  1) new ticket - Spot is alloted to car.
    - Atleast one spot with status 'available' should be present.
    - the first one ( considering nearest to entry point ) will be alloted to car.
    - Car with same color and registration number should not present in parking_site
    - spot status will be moved to blocked
    - Ticket will be created & notified with spot and car details
  
  2) Spot is emptied by car.
    - if car leaves the parking_site. We will make spot available again.
  

Code Scenes
  new ticket - register spot for new car
    - render a form
    - car details - color, registration number
  
  create ticket - allot_spot
    - if car with this color and registration number not present in parking_site and there is an available spot,
      - then will issue a ticket to this customer for the spot
      - also move spot status to blocked
    - else
      - render some text with error message
      - error message would be one of the -
      { 
        car with this color present in parking lot.
        car with this registration number present in parking lot.
        All spots are blocked. No spot is available, right now.
      }


ParkingSite.create!(name: 'East-Abhyudaya', total_spots: 8)


i=1
8.times do
  Spot.create!(spot_number: i, status: 'available', parking_site_id: ParkingSite.first.id)
  i += 1
end
